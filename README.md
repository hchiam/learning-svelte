# Learning svelte

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Svelte = less boilerplate and generate small files at build time instead of at run time. For me, it's like React in that it goes one step further in the trend: logically group together related JS, markup, [_and style_](https://css-tricks.com/what-i-like-about-writing-styles-with-svelte).

You can generate a [dependency graph](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-dependency-cruiser) with `bash show_dep_graph.sh`.
